## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
When observing the summary statistics for a Linear Regression model based on MPG, we can surmise that the vehicle length and ground clearance have the most non-random amount of variance regarding fuel economy. 
The slope is very slight at - .01
Considering the adjusted R squared value is greater than .5, (0.68), this is an accu

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
After making a summary statistics table for the values of PSI in the Suspension Coil dataset, we can conclude that that variance for PSI is in line with MechaCar standards.

However, when we seperate the statitics by lots, we can see that the third lot has an extremely high variance(170) when compared to the other two.
